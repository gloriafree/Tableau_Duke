# Tableau calculation types

calculations are embeded in calculation fields

calculation types
1. row level calculations
2. aggregated calculations
3. table level calculations (complex)


creating a CALCULATED field to flagging whether to view certain state or not, is similar as using GROUPING function and apply it to the state field.

we can make calculations with calculated fields in Tableau
