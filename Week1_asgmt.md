# Ask the right question

Instead of asking one right question, we should ask a list of key questions we can ask before analyzing data.

Questions should be direct as well as open-ended



# S.M.A.R.T object

Define the business problem and values they analysis should bring, before jump into the data. Basically, make sure the objectives are:

 1. specific
 2. measurable
 3. attainable
 4. relevant
 5. time-bound


* measurable:
How should my business metric change if my recommendations are put into action, and by how much?


>question 1: increase the returning visitor to our webpage
>question2: increase the number of returning visitors on a monthly basis by 15% compared to the same month last year


* relevant
What exactly is the business problem? And make sure your analysis align with business problem -> in this case is to increase revenue

>question 3: determine the website changes that will most efficiently increase revenues by 15% on a monthly basis compared to the same month last year


* time-bound

>question 4: within 2 months, determine the website changes that will most efficiently increase revenues by 15% on a monthly basis compared to the same month last year


* attainable
consider what data you have, and what you might need to achieve the goal

>question 5 - version 1: within 2 months, from achieved click stream data, determine the website changes that will most efficiently increase revenues by 15% on a monthly basis compared to the same month last year
>
>question 5 - version 1: within 3 months, install a system that will collect and store click-stream data in a cloud-based relational database. By 2 months after the system is installed, this data will be analyzed to determine the website changes that will most efficiently increase revenues by 15% on a monthly basis compared to the same month last year

2.identify independent variables to test
in-person meeting is critical

example questions to identify factors:
- what has been tried before?
- how did it turn out?
- what do you think might help improve this business problem?

3. determine whether stakeholders agree about problems to be solved

different data analytics types:
1. descriptive analytics: what happened?
2. diagnostic analytics: why it happened?
3. predictive analytics: what is going to happen?
4. prescriptive analytics: what recommendations can be provided?

suggestions for stakeholders that are not completely comfortable with advanced big data techniques which has not yet fit into the company's current business culture.
1. give data usage examples that have been Used
2. bring prototypes of analytics
