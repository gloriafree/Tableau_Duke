# Exercise 1
create filtering variable: remove_testing_data
find out after which games users tend to drop out by using Rank by DogID
Rank by DogID: the order of tests given to users each time

*'number of records' are not automatically generated in the new tableau version, and so I just create this my own by the calculated field*

# Exercise 2
check tests conducted by different dates
when put date at dimensions, if we check dates as continuous variable, tableau shows combination of yymmdd; if we check it as discrete variable, then we can only check any one of the perspective, by year, or by month, or by day, etc.

here, I learned to join different tables in tableau, and created the consolidated datasets for analysis


#rank function
rank function in the latest tableau is slightly different from Dr. Jana's tutorial
set the ranking at the level of 'sub-category', and restarting every 'higher category'
