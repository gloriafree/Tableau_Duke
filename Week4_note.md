#Marking your data story come alive
the way of creating emotional hooks at the beginning of your presentation:
1. tell your personal story that's alluded to your analysis and even recommendations. i.e. marking at different customers' age groups
2. using a picture
3. using objects
4. quotations
5. startling facts for other types of business problems
6. open with a dramatic survey results or statistics
7. bring a faulty equipment that is causing problems in a company factory
8. ask a question


# structure of your presentation
start and end with big picture (why, so what? what benefits?)
put all details in between to support your statements

# put all assumptions and technical details in appendix, or even white papers to outline all concrete evidences or facts


# structure insights in one presentation
at most three main insights, each with at most three sub-topics


# choose different strategy based on your recommendations:
1. when your recommendations is NOT controversial: first story point will be the most compelling story point, so you can get your audience's buy-in as quickly as possible.
2. when your recommendations is controversial: first story point will be the least compelling story point, as people are more likely to get into persuasion if you get them into general agreement in the first place.

# overgeneralization and sample bias
1. avoid making bold conclusion using the analysis you did from your data, but think about how representation of your data are.
2. recommendation:
  1. build a data intuition from past experience is very important -- domain specific
  2. ask questions about collection methods
  3. for missing data or outliers: check if there is systematic bias by looking for common characteristics for them.
  4. check number of data points

# include controls or even benchmark in your analysis, to avoid misinterpretations
